# Deep-Learning
Adding my solutions and practice problems while learning different concepts of deep learning from Coursera.
Course- Neural Networks and Deep Learning by DeepLearning.AI
* This first course of the series helped me to understand basics of neural networks and how we can improvise our basic models to get higher accuracy. 
* It covers implementation of complex classification models with different activation functions and their use cases.
